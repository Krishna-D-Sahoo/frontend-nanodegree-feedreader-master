# The Feed Reader - frontend-nanodegree-feedreader-master
---
This is the solution to the project 6 of Udacity's Frontend nanodegree program


## About the project
---
There are all total seven specs. The tests describe the functionality of various elements visible on the web page.

Well, while preparing the tests, the developer tools can be of great help like-
    
   while testing the functionality of the 'menu' button, if clicking the 'menu' icon affected the visibility of the menu or not. I took      the help of developers tools. I checked, while the clicking the 'menu' button the *body* tag in the index.html got affected. There is    certainly the absence of 'menu-hidden' class in the *body* element tag, when the 'menu' icon is clicked. You can try it yourself. This      can give you idea how to prepare your tests.


## How to view the project?
---
You can directly view the code on the github or you can download the project, check it on the local system.

The test suits are in the file - feedreader.js, inside the folder jasmine/spec.
