# The Feed Reader - frontend-nanodegree-feedreader-master
---
This is the solution to the project 6 of Udacity's Frontend nanodegree program


## About the project
---
There are all total seven specs. The tests describe the functionality of various elements visible on the web page.

Well, while preparing the tests, the developer tools can be of great help like-
    
   while testing the functionality of the 'menu' button, if clicking the 'menu' icon affected the visibility of the menu or not. I took      the help of developers tools. I checked, while the clicking the 'menu' button, how the *body* tag in the index.html got affected. There    is certainly the absence of 'menu-hidden' class in the *body* element tag, when the 'menu' icon is clicked. You can try it yourself.      This can give you idea how to prepare your tests.
